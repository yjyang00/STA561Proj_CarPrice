# Car Price Prediction

This project is created for Duke STA-561 Spring 2023 Final project. We use the second-hand car prices in North Carolina as the main dataset to make prediction. The goal of prediction is to build a model that can accurately predict the selling price of a used car based on a set of input features such as the carâ€™s make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors. We proposed an improved Lasso technique under a missing data framework to enable automatic variable selection and to identify the key variables that impact car prices, together with further ensembling methods to leverage the strengths of multiple models. To further improve the prediction performance, we incorporate a voting regressor and meta-analysis into their model framework. Overall, the proposed statistical model offers both theoretical and applicable advantages, including performing automatic variable selection, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the available features and car prices, enhancing model performance through ensembling methods, and enabling generalization to other prediction tasks.
