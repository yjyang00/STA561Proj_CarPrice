# Car Price Prediction

This project is created for Duke STA-561 Spring 2023 Final project. We use the second-hand car prices in North Carolina as the main dataset to make prediction. The goal of prediction is to build a model that can accurately predict the selling price of a used car based on a set of input features such as the carâ€™s make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors.
